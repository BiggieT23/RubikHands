# RubikHand – Learn the Rubik’s Cube Through Sign Language

**RubikHand** is a visual-first, inclusive simulator and tutorial platform that teaches how to solve the Rubik’s Cube using **non-algorithmic intuition** combined with **South African Sign Language (SASL)**.

Created by **Tinotenda (Tino) Magaya**, this project empowers Deaf learners to master the cube naturally — no complex formulas, just understanding and signs.

## ✨ Features
- 🎮 Interactive 3D Rubik’s Cube Simulator
- 👐 SASL overlays for each move (GIFs, videos, or avatar)
- 🧠 Non-algorithmic solving methods — think, feel, turn
- 📚 Step-by-step lessons with signs, gestures, and real logic
- 🧑‍🏫 RubikHand Tutor Mode — your personal guide in SASL

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- JavaScript (Three.js for 3D Cube)
- HTML/CSS
- Sign overlays (video or image)
- GitHub Pages (for hosting)

## 💡 Vision
RubikHand is part of Tahir’s mission to make **STEM + logic puzzles** more accessible for the Deaf community — one cube, one sign, one hand at a time.
